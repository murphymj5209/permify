title: Write Schema
openapi: post /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/schemas/write

Permify provide it's own authorization language to model common patterns of easily. We called the authorization model Permify Schema and it can be created on our [playground](https://play.permify.co/) as well as in any IDE or text editor. 

We also have a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Permify.perm) to ease modeling Permify Schema with code snippets and syntax highlights. Note that on VS code the file with extension is ***".perm"***.

<Warning>
If you're planning to test Permify manually, maybe with an API Design platform such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), etc; we're suggesting using our playground to create model. Because Permify Schema needs to be configured (send to API) in Permify API in a **string** format. Therefore, created model should be converted to **string**. 

Although, it could easily be done programmatically, it could be little challenging to do it manually. To help on that, we have a button on the playground to copy created model to the clipboard as a string, so you get your model in string format easily.

</Warning>

Permify Schema needed to be send to API endpoint **/v1/schemas/write"** for configuration of your authorization model on Permify API.

### Example Request on Postman
**POST** `/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/schemas/write`
